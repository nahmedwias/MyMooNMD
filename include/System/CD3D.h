 *             (cdr) problem
 *
 *             Store matrix, right hand side, FE spaces, FE functions and 
 *             the solution vector of a convection-diffusion problem. This 
 *             wraps up everything which is necessary to solve a convection

 *
 *             Here are some tasks for class CD3D
 *             \todo enable different discretizations/stabilizations
 *             \todo enable direct solver in MPI
 *             \todo test multigrid with all smoothers (so far: only SSOR)
