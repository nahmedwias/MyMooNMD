 * @brief Apply the linear Crank-Nicolson FEM-FCT algorithm for
 * time-dependent convection-diffusion-reaction problems to a CDR system.
 *
 * The algorithm is the FEM-FCT variant which is described in Chapter 7 of
 * D.Kuzmin(2009): Explicit and implicit FEM-FCT algorithms with flux
 * linearization.
 * J Comput. Phys. 228(7) pp. 2517--2534.
 *
 * TODO CB: In the algorithm, the explicit part of the C-N scheme is computed
 * using the transport operator K_{k} of the current time step and not K_{k-1}
 * of the previous timestep.
 * Could one run into trouble when the transport is time dependent?
 *
 * @param[in] mass Consistent mass matrix.
 * @param[in, out] stiff High order transport matrix (
 * before modifications due to time stepping!). Gets modified to be the
 * system matrix of the system which has to be solved finally (so will include
 * modifications due to flux correction AND to timestepping). Must have been
 * assembled with the INTERNAL_FULL_MATRIX_STRUCTURE switch on (but that will
 * not be checked by the algorithm).
 * @param[in] oldsol The solution vector of the last time step.
 * @param[in] rhs The current right hand side (before modifications due to
 * timestepping!). Will be modified as to be the the right hand side of the =
 * system which has to be solved finally (so it will include
 * modifications due to flux correction AND to timestepping).
 * @param[in, out] rhs_old The right hand side of the last time step
 * (without modification). As output, stores the right hand side of the current
 * time step without modifications.
 * @param[in] delta_t The current time step length.
 * @param[in] neum_to_diri array which contains the indices of actual
 * Dirichlet dof which were but treated as Neumann dof due to
 * INTERNAL_FULL_MATRIX_STRUCTURE.
 * @param[in] prelim Which prelimiter to use, if at all.
