\section why_testing Why are doing unit tests at all?

In general we need to be confident that our code does what we claim it does. 
This is not only true for the moment we write it, but it should remain true in 
the future, even if changes are made to it by someone else. The only way to be 
sure results have not changed, is to test. Oftentimes people to some kind of 
testing already. They might start one of their programs and check convergence 
orders, look at the visualization of a solution. Experienced researchers are
often able to spot some errors this way, however it is extremely hard to find 
out where exactly the problem has occurred and why someone had changed the code
there. Also this way only a very specific part of the code is tested at all and
minor differences are not identified as errors.

Here is a list of reasons why we should do unit testing. 

1.  Larger changes in the code can easily be done because the developers can be
    confident that their changes work and don't introduce new bugs.
2.  Even inexperienced developers can safely commit, knowing they did not 
    produce bugs (at least not in the tested part of the code).
3.  Think about interfaces rather than implementation of classes. After all 
    classes are written to be used. Tests help to clarify what the interface 
    should look like and capable of.
4.  Unit tests are some sort of documentation. They demonstrate how a class is 
    supposed to be used, similar to a reference implementation.
5.  Unit tests are easily run and give the developer instant feedback on his 
    work.
6.  Most developers do testing already but throw their test once finished with
    the implementation. Keeping the test will guarantee your code is still 
    functioning in the future. That means there is only *little extra coding*
    necessary.
7.  Bad code can be identified writing tests. This includes clumsy interfaces, 
    wrong/outdated documentation as well as memory leaks, and probably more.
8.  Even simple tests are much better than no tests.
9.  Finding a bug, writing a test for it, fixing the bug. This particular bug
    will never appear again, while it might do so without the test.

But what if
-   you think you newly implemented method does not need to be tested, because
    it is too small? Well, then the test will be small as well and take only a
    few minutes to implement. Finding an error which turns out to be in such a 
    function will take much more time. So testing small pieces is especially 
    simple and should be done.
-   you think you newly implemented method does not need to be tested, because
    it is too large? This is a really good indication the code needs to be 
    rewritten. We want small understandable and testable methods. So bad code 
    is no excuse to not write tests, making the code even worse.

In summary we encourage you to **create tests** whenever you write code. It is 
strongly recommended to always **run the tests** before committing anything in 
the version control system. 







\section running_tests Running the tests

You can run the test suite from within your build directory calling

    make check
after you called `cmake` of course, which is described
\ref page_build_system "here". This will build everything needed to run the 
test, and then run it. Internally we use `ctest` which ships with `cmake`. 

The output will list all the tests together with their status (Passed/Failed) 
and the duration of the test. In the end a summary is provided showing the 
number of passed/failed tests. We always want all tests to pass. Do not commit 
code which does not fulfill this requirement. 


Note that cmake provides a target `make test` which does almost the same as 
`make check`. The difference is that `make test`, similarly to calling `ctest`, 
will not recompile your code. So changing the test or the method to be tested 
will not change the test result. That's why ParMooN implements the `make check` 
target which overcomes this problem. It is described in more detail in the file 
`test/CMakeLists.txt`.


\subsection options_running_tests More options on running tests

If you want to run only a fraction of all tests, this is possible only with 
`ctest`. Remember that this will not recompile the test. 

From within your build directory call `ctest` with options to change its 
behavior. The man-page gives a good overview on all options. The ones that 
might be the most useful are presented here.
    
- to run all tests in a more verbose mode (option `--verbose` or `-V`)

      ctest --verbose
    
- to run a range of tests (option `--tests-information` or `-I`), for example 
  the first three

      ctest --tests-information 1,3
  use this also to run an individual test: `ctest -I 1,1`
  
- run all tests whose names match a regular expression (option `--tests-regex` 
  or `-R`)
  
      ctest --tests-regex matrix
    
- run all tests, but only write their output if they failed

      ctest --output-on-failure


\subsection debugging_tests Debugging tests

The tests are normal executables, similar to the ones you get with most of the 
standard targets, e.g. `make cd2d`. Therefore you can also use the debugger to
run a test. Say you want to debug the first test. The executable is somewhere 
hidden in the directory structure cmake constructs. To find out which 
executable corresponds to a test call

    ctest -I 1,1 -V -N

The test is not run due to the option -N which is not introduced in the 
previous section \ref options_running_tests. However there is a line in the 
output starting with
> 1: Test command: 
The rest of that line is the executable you wanted. You can run it just like 
any other program, in particular you can use for example the gnu debugger on 
it. As a graphical alternative (on a Linux machine) you can try KDbg, call it 
via `kdbg executable`.



\section creating_tests Creating a new test

Creating a new test is done in two steps which are described in the following
- Create a file in the `test` subdirectory, say `matrix_test.c++`. The name of 
  the file should ideally correspond to a file in one of the 
  subdirectories in the `include` subdirectory. Usually one class is tested in 
  one file. The file is a normal `c++` program. It should contain a method 
  `main` and return `0` upon success. A failure is indicated by either 
  returning something else than `0` or throwing an exception. Also a
  segmentation fault indicates failure, of course. Some more remarks on this 
  file (some do not only apply to tests, but are more general):
  - try to include as few files as possible
  - include only header files from the `include` subdirectory or the standard 
    library
  - you can define functions if you like
  - you can test a number of methods of a class within one test file, typically 
    there is one test file per class
  - the test can be quite verbose, during the regular call to `make check` all
    output is suppressed anyway. 
    
- add the test to the file `test/CMakeLists.txt`. In this file you add the 
  following lines
  \code{.cmake}
  add_executable(ParMooN_test_matrix matrix_test.c++)
  target_link_libraries(ParMooN_test_matrix parmoon_2d_${PARMOON_PARALLEL_TYPE})
  add_test(matrix ParMooN_test_matrix)
  list(APPEND parmoon_tests ParMooN_test_matrix)
  \endcode
  The first line defines an executable, called `ParMooN_test_matrix`, with your 
  test file. The name of the executable is usually preceeded by `ParMooN_`. The 
  second line makes sure the executable is linked to the correct library. If
  you test something in 3D, you have to replace the `2d` in 
  `parmoon_2d_${PARMOON_PARALLEL_TYPE}` by `3d`. The third line creates a test
  using the executable. The name of the test is simply matrix. You can choose 
  any meaningful name here. The last line is needed only so that `make check` 
  works as described above. It adds the test to the list of tests.




\section testing_mac Testing on a Mac

In the case that some tests fail similar to the following example

\code
29/30 Test #29: multigrid_2d .....................***Not Run   0.00 sec
Start 30: multigrid_3d
Test not available without configuration.  (Missing "-C <config>"?)
\endcode

the strategy below is possibly a remedy.
The reason for the fail might be that in the
\code
Build/CMakeCache.txt
\endcode
the slot

\code
CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES:STRING=
\endcode

is set to

\code
Debug; Release; MinSizeRel; RelWithDebInfo
\endcode

or something else. \n
<b>Make sure that nothing is assigned here.</b>

<i>Remark</i>:\n
The parameter
\code
CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=
\endcode
can be chosen to be
\code
Debug; Release; MinSizeRel; RelWithDebInfo.
\endcode

This choice has direct consequences on the compile time (due to optimization restrictions) and debug information.\n
Debug: standard mode with debug information\n
Realease: increased compile time (high level of optimization at the compile time) &harr decreased run-time ; no debug information available\n
MinSizeRel: ... \n
RelWithDebInfo: increased compile time (high level of optimization at the compile time) &harr decreased run-time ; debug information available\n
\n
Note: In practice, a decreasing compile time typically correlates with an increasing run-time and vice versa.
